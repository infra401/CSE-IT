Introdunction to Data Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is Data?
The quantities, characters or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer, which may be stored and transmitted in the form of electrical signals
and recorded on magnetic , optical or mechanical recording media. 
 ex:- c = a + b

WHen Data becomes information?

Data: ANIANUS SI EMAN YM
Information : MY NAME IS SUNAINA

If data is structured in a systematic way then it gets a structure and become meaningful. 
This meaningful or processed data is called information.

Its not difficult to understand that the data needs to be managed in such a way so that it can produce some meaningful information.

To provide an appropriate way to structure the data, we need to know about
DATA STRUCTURES

What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a systematic way to organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
Ex: arrays

Instead of creating multiple variables of same type, why not create an array to store all the values.
Storing strings is equivalent of storing a sequence of characters. This requires an array.

Some real life examples:

1. Did you know?
Stack data structure is used in implementing redo and undo feature.

The primary goal of neso academy is to provide quality education
  |              | 
  |              |
  | cation       |
  | ed           |
  | quality      |
  ----------------
    undo stack

press ctrl+z (undo )

it selects the element and pop it out
into redo stack

|        |
|        |
| cation |
|        |
----------
ctrl+ y (redo)

Ex 2:-
Which data structure is used to store an image as a bitmap ?
ARRAYS

Bitmap images are stored as a series of tiny dots called pixels.
Here each pixel is usually a small square that is assigned a color and then aranged in a pattern to form an image
A 2 dimensional array of size 37 x 40 is enough to store this image.

ex 3:-
Storing the friendship information on a social networking site

using graph

Data Types vs Abstract Data Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is a Data Type?

Two important things about data types:
1. Defines a certain domain of values
2. Defines Operations allowed on those values.

Example:-

int type
- takes only integer values
- Operations: addition,subtraction, multiplication, bitwise operations etc.

float type
- Takes only floating point values
- Operations: addition, subtractions, multiplication, division etc (bitwise and % operations are not allowed).


USER DEFINED DATA TYPES
-------------------------
In contrast to primitive data types, there is a concept of user defined data types.
The operations and values of user defined data types are not specified in the language but is specified by the user.

example: structure, union and enumeration

By using structures, we are defining our own type by combining other data types.

   struct point {
          int x;
          int y;
   };


ABSTRACT DATA TYPES (ADT)
-----------------------------
ADTs are like user defined data types which defines operations on values using functions without specifying 
what is there inside the function and how the operations are performed.

example: Stack ADT

Operations:
initialize() - initializing it to be empty
Push() - insert an element into the stack
Pop() - Delete an element from the stack
isEmpty() - checks if stack is empty
isFull() - checks if stack is full


Think of ADT as a black box which hides the inner structure and design of the data type from the user.
There are multiple ways to implement an ADT.

example: 
A stack ADT can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.


Why ADT ?
-----------------
The program which uses data strucutre is called client program
It has access to the ADT i.s interface.
The program which implements the data structure is known as the implementation.

Advantage:-
Let say, if someone wnats to use the stack in the program, then he can simply use push and pop operations 
without knowing its implementation.
Also, in future, the implementation of stack is changed from array to linked list, then the client program will work in the 
same way without being affected.

Conclusion
ADT provies ABSTRACTION.
