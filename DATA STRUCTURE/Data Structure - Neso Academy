What is Data?
The quantities, characters or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer, which may be stored and transmitted in the form of electrical signals
and recorded on magnetic , optical or mechanical recording media. 
 ex:- c = a + b

WHen Data becomes information?

Data: ANIANUS SI EMAN YM
Information : MY NAME IS SUNAINA

If data is structured in a systematic way then it gets a structure and become meaningful. 
This meaningful or processed data is called information.

Its not difficult to understand that the data needs to be managed in such a way so that it can produce some meaningful information.

To provide an appropriate way to structure the data, we need to know about
DATA STRUCTURES

What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a systematic way to organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
Ex: arrays

Instead of creating multiple variables of same type, why not create an array to store all the values.
Storing strings is equivalent of storing a sequence of characters. This requires an array.

Some real life examples:

1. Did you know?
Stack data structure is used in implementing redo and undo feature.

The primary goal of neso academy is to provide quality education

  | cation       |
  | ed           |
  | quality      |
  ----------------
    undo stack

press ctrl+z (undo )

it selects the element and pop it out
into redo stack

|        |
| cation |
|        |
----------
ctrl+ y (redo)

Ex 2:-
Which data structure is used to store an image as a bitmap ?
ARRAYS

Bitmap images are stored as a series of tiny dots called pixels.
Here each pixel is usually a small square that is assigned a color and then aranged in a pattern to form an image
A 2 dimensional array of size 37 x 40 is enough to store this image.

ex 3:-
Storing the friendship information on a social networking site

using graph
