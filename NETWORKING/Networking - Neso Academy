***********************************************************************************************************

COMPUTER NETWORK
................
set of nodes connected by communication links. 
communication link can be wired or wireless, link carries information
node - can be computer , printer, router, or any other device capable of sending or receiving data 

BASIC CHARACERISTIC 
1. FAULT TOLERANCE - ability to continue working despite failure , ensure no loss of service
2. SCALABILITY - ability to grow based on needs, have good performance after growth 
3. QUALITY OF SERVICE (QoS) - ability to set priorities , manage data traffic to reduce loss delay etc

**************************************************************************************************************

DATA COMMUNICATION
exchange of data between two nodes via some form of link (transmission medium) like cable
*****************************************************************8

DATA FLOW 
1. SIMPLEX - one direction only , communication always unidirectional , one device transmit and other receive, (eg, keyboard, monitor) 
2. HALF DUPLEX - two directions, one at a time ;if one is sending other can only receive and vice versa (eg walkies-talkies)
3. FULL DUPLEX- two directions at the same time ; device can send and receive at the same time (eg telephone line)
*******************************************************************************************************************

PROTOCOLS
set of rules that govern data communication

ELEMENTS:
1.Message encoding
message source ->  encoder(signal) -> transmitter -> receiver -> decoder(signal) -> message destination
2.Message formatting and encapsulation

NETWORK TOPOLOGY
arrangement of nodes of a computer network
topology=layout

physical topology= placement of various nodes
logical topology = deals with data flow in network

NETWORK TOPOLOGY TYPES:-

1. BUS
all data transmitted b/w nodes in network is transmitted over this common transmission medium and is able to be
receive by all nodes in network simultaneously
A signal containing address of intended receiving machine travels from a source machine in both directions to all 
machines connected to bus until it finds intended recipient

                 comp1     comp2        comp3 
                 |          |            |
*terminator.......................................terminator* 
                    |            | 
                comp4          comp5

advantages: 
~only 1 wire - less expensive
~ suited for temporary network 
~ node failure does not affect others
disadvantages:-
~ not fault tolerant (no redundancy)
~limited cable length
~no security

2. RING
bus topology in closed loop ; peer to peer LAN topology
2 connections one to each of its nearest neighbors
unidirectional
sending and receiving takes place with help of TOKEN

          |........comp1................|
       comp2                           comp

           |                            |
           .............comp.............
advantages:-
~ better than bus
~ can cause bottleneck due to weak links
~ all nodes with equal access
disadvantages:- 
unidirectional , single point of failure will affect whole network
increase in load , decrease in performance
no security

3. STAR
every node connected to cenral node(hub or switch)
centralized management
all traffic must pass through hu or switch
                          comp1
                             |

                             |
                          comp4

advantages:-
~easy to design and implement
~ centralized administration
~ scalable
disadvantages:-
~ single point of failure affect whole network
~bottlenecks due to overloaded switch/hub
~ increased cost due to switch /hub

Imagine a highway with a single lane. If there's a lot of traffic, cars will slow down and back up. This is like a bottleneck in a network.

In a network, a bottleneck is a point where the performance is significantly limited. It's like a narrow bridge or a traffic jam on a highway.

BASICS OF IP ADDRESSING

IP ADDRESS
~IP= internet protocol
~every node in computer network is identified with help of IP address
~logical address
~can change based on location of device
~assigned manually or dynamically
~represented in decimal and has 4 octects(xxxx)
~ 0.0.0.0  to 255.255.255.255 (32 bits)
.......................................................................
HOW TO SEE IP ADDRESSING IN REAL DEVICE

open cmd
c:\users/shrikha> ipconfig
******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
MAC ADDRESS

MAC = media access control
~every node in LAN is identified with Mac address
~physical or hardware address; unique
~cannot be changed
~assigned by manufacturer
~representation in hexadecimal
~ very important in LAN
example:- 70-20-84-ED-FC (48 bits)
~separator: hyphen(-), period() and colon(:)
~IP address (router friendly addresses)= location of person
~Mac address(switch friendly addresses) = name of person


Router takes forward decision based on IP addresses

IP ADDRESS                                  MAC ADDRESS
32 bits                                       48 bits
represented in decimal                      hexadecimal
router needs IP to forward data       switch need Mac to forward data
ex:- 10.10.23.56                        ex:- 70-20-84-00-ED-FC
...........................................................
HOW TO SEE MAC ADDRESS
open cmd
c:\users\sunaina> ipconfig/all
physical address is Mac address
***************************************************************************************************************************************************************

BASICS OF PORT ADDRESSING(PORT NUMBER)
~ in a node, many processes will be running
~ data which are sent/received must reach the right person
~every process in node is uniquely identified using port numbers
~port= communication endpoint
~fixed port numbers and dynamic port numbers (0- 65535)
fixed port numbers:- 25,80 etc
OS assigned dynamic port numbers:- 62414

Derivations from analogy
reaching our city = reaching our network (IP address)
reaching our apartment = reaching the host (Mac address)
reaching the right person = reaching the right process (Port address)
......................................................................
HOW TO SEE PORT NUMBERS??
in windows, search for resmon 
resmon = resource monitoring 
go to network, port numbes are visible
....................................................
3 KEY POINTS TO PONDER
before sending the data, any node must
~attach source IP addres and destination IP address
~attach source MAC address and destination MAC address
~attach source port number and destination port number
******************************************************************************************************************************************************************

SWITCHING TECHNIQUES
~In computer network, it helps in deciding best route for data transmission if there are multiple pathe in larger network.
~one-to-one connection

                                                            |.....VIRTUAL CIRCUIT APPROACH

CIRCUIT SWITCHING
~ dedicated path is established b/w sender and receiver
~ before data transfer, connection will be established first
ex:- telephone network

3 phases in circuit switching:
~ connection establishment
~ data transfer
~ connection disconnection

MESSAGE SWITCHING
~ store and forward mechanism
~ message is transferred as a complete unit and forwarded using store and forward mechanism at the intermediary node.
~ not suited for streaming media and real-time applications.

PACKET SWITCHING
~ the internet is a packet switched network.
~message is broken into individual chunks called packets
~ each packet is sent individually
~each packet will have source and destination IP address with sequence number
~sequence number will help receiver to
 reorder the packets
 detect missing packets
send acknowledgements

PACKET SWITCHING - DATAGRAM APPROACH
~aka connectionless switching
~each independent entity is called datagram
~datagram contains destination information and intermediary devices uses this information to forward diagrams to right destination
~path is not fixed
~intermediate nodes take the routing decisions to forward packets.
~ reordering done by receiver

PACKET SWITCHING - VIRTUAL CIRCUIT APPROACH
~ aka connection-oriented approach
~a preplanned route is established before messages are sent
~ call request and call accept packets are used to establish the connction b/w sender and receiver
~path is fixed for duration of a logical connection

THE OSI MODEL
..............
~ OSI= open system interconnection
~ model for understanding and designing architet i.e flexible, robust, and interoperable
~ developed by international standards for organiations (ISO)
~ it is not a protocol
~ it is only a guidance and hence referred as OSI reference model.
~ Purpose is to show how to facilitate communication b/w different systems without requiring changes to the logic of underlying hardware and software.
~ OSI model was never fully implemented.

THE TCP/IP MODEL
..................
~ TCP/IP = transmission control protocol/ internet protocol
~ TCO/IP protocol suite was develooped prior to OSI model.Therefore, layers in TCP/IP protocol suite do not exactly match those in OSI model
~ It is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, each of which provides a specific functionality.

---------------------------
~ provides a dedicated link b/w two devices
~ the entire capacity of the link is reserved for transmission b/w those devices

MULTIPOINT CONNECTION
---------------------------
~ it is also called multidrop configuration or broadcast connection
~ two or more devices share a single link
~ since more than two devices share the link, the capacity of the channe; is shared now
~ it can be spatial or temporal

LINK LAYER SERVICES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DATA LINK LAYER
------------------
~ It is responsible for moving data (frames) from one node to another.

Services provided by Data Link Layer:-
~Framing
~ Physical Addressing 
~ Flow Control
~ Error Control
~ Access Control

FRAMING
--------------
~ The data link layer needs to pack bits into frames, so that each frame is distinguished from another.
~ Our postal system practices a type of framing.
~ The simple act of inserting a letter into an envelope separates one piece of information from another; the envelope serves as the delimiter.

PHYSICAL ADDRESSING
-------------------
~ A frame is the encapsulation of the header and trailer information with the packet.
~ In the header, the source and the destination MAC address are dealt.

FLOW CONTROL
----------------
~ Flow control is one of the duties of data link control sublayer.
~ The flow control in data link layer is end to end flow control.
~ Speed matching mechanism.
~ Flow control coordinates the amount of data that can be sent before receiving an acknowledgement.

ACCESS CONTROL
-------------
~ media access control

ERROR CONTROL
----------------
~ error detection 
~ error correction

SUBLAYERS OF THE DATA LINK LAYER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. LLC Sublayer
2. MAC Sublayer

LLC OR DLC SUBLAYER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ logical link control sublayer or data link control sublayer 
~ handles communication b/w upper and lower layers.
~ Takes the network protocol data and adds control information to help deliver the packet to the destination. (flow control)

MAC SUBLAYER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Constitutes the lower sublayer of the data link layer.
~ Implemented by hardware, typically in the computer NIC.
~ Two primary responsibilities:-
  data encapsulation
  media access control

Data encapsulation :-
~ Frame assembly before transmission and frame disassembly upon reception of a frame.
~ MAC layer adds a header and trailer to the network layer PDU.

Provides three primary functions :-
~ framing
~ physical addressing or MAC addressing
~ error control

~ Responsible for the placement of frames on the media and the removal of frames from the media.
~ Communicates directly with the physical layer.

FRAMING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ When node A wishes to transmit a frame to node B, it tells its adapter to transmit a frame from the node's memory.
~ This results in a sequence of bits being sent over the link.
~ The adapter on node B then collects together the sequence of bits arriving on the link and deposits the corresponding frame in B's memory.
~ Challenge: What set of bits constitute a frame?

Types of Framing:-
1. Fixed-Size Framing
2. Variable-Size Framing

Fixed-Sized Framing
------------------------
~ Here the size of the frame is fixed and so the frame length acts as delimiter of the frame.
~ Consequnetly, it does not require additional boundary bits to identify the start and end of the frame.

Variable-Size Framing
--------------------------
~ Here, the size of each frame to be transmitted may be different.
~ So additional mechanisms are kept to mark the end of one frame and the beginning of the next frame.

Various framing approaches
1. Bit Oriented
2. Byte Oriented

~ Address -1 byte which is set to 11111111 in case of broadcast
~ Control - 1 byte set to a constant value of 11000000
~ Protocol - 1 or 2 bytes that define the type of data contained in the payload field.
~ Payload - This carries the data from the network layer. The maximum length of the payload field is 1500 bytes. However, this may be negotiated b/w the endpoints of communication.
~ Checksum - error detection

ERROR:-
~ Data are transmitted in the network
~ The data can be corrupted during transmission
~ Transmission error
~ For reliable communication, errors must be detected and corrected.
~ Error detection and correction are implemented either at the data link layer or the transport layer of the OSI model.

TYPES OF ERROR:-
1. Bit Error
2. Burst Error

BIT ERROR
----------
~ a.k.a single bit error
~ In a single bit error, only 1 bit in the data unit has been changed.

                         0 changed to 1

How To Detect The Errors ?
~ Error detection means to decide whether the received data is correct or not without having a copy of the original message
~ To detect or correct errors, we need to send some extra bits with the data.

2. Sum all the 'k' data blocks.
3. Add the carry to the sum, if any
4. Do 1's complement to the sum = checksum

PERFORMANCE OF CHECKSUM:
~ The checksum detects all errorsinvolving an odd numbe of bits
~ It detects most errors involving an even number of bits.
~ If one or more bits of a segment are damaged and the corresponding bit or bits of opposite values in a second segment are also damaged,
the sum of those columns will not change and the receiver will not detect the error(s).

NETWORK PERFORMANCE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One important issue in networking is the performance of the network - how good is it?

Network performance is measured in following fundamental ways
~ Bandwidth
~ Throughput
~ Latency (Delay)

DERIVATIONS FROM ANALOGY
The bandwidth is 1000 cars per minute.
The throughput is 100 cars per minute.

BANDWIDTH
---------------
Informal :- Maximum amount of data that can be transmitted per second.
Formal   :- The bandwidth of a network is given by the number of bits that can be transmitted over the network in a certain period of time.

Bandwidth in bps
Bandwidth = capability
ex:- Gigabit ethernet can provide a bandwidth of 1 Gbps

Bandwidth in Hertz
A range of frequencies used to transmit signals which is measures in hertz.

THROUGHPUT
----------------
Informal :- Actual amount of data that passes through the medium
Formal   :- The throughput is a measure of how fast we can actually send data through a network

Although bandwidth in bits per second and throughpu seem the same, they are different.

A link may have a bandwidth of 'B' bps, but we can only send 'T' bps through this link with T <B always.

We may have a link with a bandwidth of 1 Mbps, but the devices connected to the end of the link may handle only 200 kbps. This means that we 
cannot send more than 200 kbps through this link.

LATENCY (DELAY)
The latency or delay defines how long it takes for an entire message to complelety arrive at the destination from the first bit is sent out from
the source.

COMPONENTS OF LATENCY (DELAY)
Latency is made of four components:
1. Transmission delay
2. Propagation delay
3. Queueing delay
4. Processing delay

Latency = transmission delay + propagation delay + queueing delay + processing delay
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
CLASS 52

LATENCY (DELAY)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The latency or delay defines how long it takes for an entire message to completely arrive at the destination from the time,
the first bit is sent out from the source.

COMPONENTS OF LATENCY (DELAY)
1. Transmission delay
2. Propagation delay
3. Queuing delay
4. Processing delay

TRANSMISSION DELAY
---------------------
Time it takes to place the complete data packet on the transmission medium.

device A         intermediate node   intermeditate node         device B
  |....................|....................|......................|

transmission time = message size
                     _______________
                      bandwidth

PROPAGATION DELAY
---------------------
Time it takes for a bit to go from device A to device B
The propagation time is calculated by dividing the distance by the propagation speed.

device A         intermediate node   intermeditate node         device B
  |....................|....................|......................|

QUEUING DELAY
----------------
~ the third component in latency is the queuing time, the time taken for each intermediate or end device to hold the mesage 
before it can be processed.
~ The queing time is not a fixed factor; it changs with the load imposed on the network.
~ When there is heavy traffic on the network, the queuing time increses.

device A         intermediate node   intermeditate node         device B
  |....................|....................|......................|

PROCESSING DELAY
---------------
~ How much time the node takes to process the message?

device A         intermediate node   intermeditate node         device B
  |....................|....................|......................|

Bandwidth: 1 bps  Delay: 5 s
Bandwidth x delay = 5 bits
here ms = milli sec

example: Consider that the link capacity of a channel is 512 kbps and round - trip delay time is 1000ms.
solution:
THe bandwidth delay product = 512 kbps x 1000 ms
                            = 512 x 1000bits/sec x 1000 x 10^-3sec
                            = 512,000 bits
                            = 64,000 bytes

Ques: What is the propagation time if the distanc eb/w the two points is 12,000 km? Assume the propagation speed to be 2.4 x 10^8 m/s in cable.
given: 
distance = 12000 km
propagation speeed = 2.4 x 10^8 m/s
to find:
propagation time

answer:-
propagation time 
= distance / propagation speed
= 12000 x 1000 / 2.4 x 10^8 sec
= 5000 x 1000 / 10^8 sec
= 5000 x 1000 x 10^-3  sec
  _____________________
  10^8        x 10^-3 

= 5000 x 1000 x 1  millisec
  _______________
  10^8   x 10^-3

=  5000 x 1000 x 10^3   millisec
  _____________________
      10^8 x 1

= 50 x 100 x 1000 x 10^3 millisec
 _______________________
     10^8 x 1

propagation time = 50 millisec or 50 ms

ROUND TRIP TIME (RTT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ a.k.a Round Trip Delay Time (RTD)
~ It is the length of time  it takes for a signal to be sent plus the length of time it takes for an 
acknowledgement of that signal to be received.
~ This time therefore consists of the propagation times b/w the two point of signal.
~ If Tp is the propagation time, then
RTT = 2 x Tp

FLOW CONTROL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data link layer
------------------
it is responsible for moving data(frames) from one node to another
services provided by the data link layer:-
~ framing
~ error control
~ flow control
~ physical addressing
~ access control

FLOW CONTROL
-----------------
~ Speed matching mechanism.
~ Flow control coordinates the amount of data that can be sent before receiving an acknowledgement.
~ Flow control is a set of procedures that sells the sender how much data it can transmit before it must wait for an acknowledgement from the receiver.
~ Receiver has a limited speed at which it can process incoming data and a limited amount of memory in which to store incoming data.
~ Receiver must inform the sender before the limits are reachd and request that the transmitter to send fewer frames or stop temporarily

STOP-AND-WAIT PROTOCOL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Stop-and-Wait protocol is data link layer protocol for transmission of frames over noiseless channels.
~ It provides unidirectional data transmission with flow control facilities but without error control facilities.
~ The idea of stop-and-wait protocol is straightforward.
~ After transmitting one frame, the sender waits for an acknowledgement before transmitting the next frame.

PRIMITIVES OF STOP-AND-WAIT-PROTOCOL
--------------------------------------
Sender Side
rule 1: send one data packet at a time
rule 2. send the next packet only after receiving ACK for the previous.

Receiver side
rule 1: Receive and consume data packet.
rule 2: After consuming packet, ACK need to be sent (flow control)

PROBLEMS OF STOP-AND-WAIT PROTOCOL
---------------------------------------
1. Problems due to lost data
  ~ Sender waits for ack for an infinite amount of time.
  ~ Receivr waits for data an infinite amount of time
2. Problem dut to lost ACK
  ~ Sender waits for an infinite amount of time for ack.
3. Problem due to delayed ACK/data
  ~ After timeout on sender side, a delayed ack might be wrongly considered as ack of some other packet data.

STOP-AND-WAIT ARQ PROTOCOL
---------------------------------
~ Idea of stop-and-wait protocol is straightforward.
~ After transmitting one frame, the sender waits for an acknowledgement before transmitting the next frame.
~ If the acknowledgement does not arive after a certain period of time, the sender times out and retransmits the original frame;
~ Stop-and-wait ARQ = Stop-and-Wait + timeout timer + sequence number

STOP-AND-WAIT ARQ  - DRAWBACKS
-------------------------------------
~ One frame at a time
~ Poor utilization of bandwidth
~ poor performance

GO-BACK-N-ARQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'N' is he sender window size
~ Go-Back-N ARQ uses the concept of protocol pipelining i.e, the sender can send multiple frames before receiving the acknowledgement for the first frame.
~ There are finite number of frames and the frames are numbered in a sequential manner.
~ The number of frams that can be sent depends on the window size of the sender.
~ If the acknowledgement of a frame is not received within an agrred upon time period, all frames in the current window are transmitted. 

~ N -sender's window size
~ for example, if the sending window size is 4 (2^2), then the sequence numbers will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, and so on
~ The number of bits in the sequence number is 2 to generate the binary sequence 00, 01, 10, 11.

8th 9th packet send
6th packet ack send
7th packet not received 
8th 9th packet also get cancelled
7th 8th th packet resend

QUES:-
The distance b/w two stations M and N is L kilometers. All frames are K bits long. The propagation time per kilometer is t seconds. Let R bts/second be 
the channel capacity. Assuming the processing delay is negligible, the minimum number of bits for the sequence number field in a frame for maximum
utilization, when the sliding window protocol is used as:
A. log2(2L + R + 2K  /  K)
B log2 (2L  + R  /   K)
C. log2 (2L + R + K   /  k)
D. log2 (2L + R + K   /   2K)

Ans:-
Let pro[agation delay = Lt sec
Round trip time = 2 x propagation delay
Round Trip Time = 2 x Lt sec
Round Trip time = 2 Lt sec
No. of bits transmitted in round trip = 2 LtR bits
         
No. of frames = (2L + R / K)
Let the bits in the sequence numbers be b.
2^b = (2L + R / K)
Take log on both sides, we get
b = log^2(2L + R / K)

MULTIPLE ACCESS PROTOCOLS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Why Multiple Access Protocols ?
~ If there is a delayed link b/w the sender and receiver then data link control layer is sufficient, however if there is no dedicated link present 
then multiple stations can access the channel simultaneously.
~ Hence multiple access protocols are rquired to decrease collision and avoid crosstalk.

RANDOM ACCESS PROTOCOLS
--------------------------------
~ In this, all situations have same superiority that is no station has more priority than another station. Any station can send data depending on medium's 
state (idle or busy).
~ In a random access method, each station has the right to the medium without being controlled by any other station.
~ If more than one station tries to send, there is an access conflict (COLLISION) and the frames will be wither destroyed or modified.


To avoid access conflict, each station follows a procedure.
~ When can the station access the medium?
~ What can the station do if the medium is busy ?
~ How can the station determine the success or failure of the transmission ? 
~ What can the station do if there is an access conflist ? 

RANDOM ACCESS PROTOCOLS
1. ALOHA
2. CSMA
3. CSMA / CD
4. CSMA / CA

CONTROLLED ACCESS PROTOCOLS
------------------------------
~ In controlled access. the stations consult one another to find which station has the right to send.
~ A station cannot send unless it has been authorized by other stations.

Controlled-acces protocols
1. Reservation
2. Polling 
3. Token Passing

CHANNELIZATION PROTOCOLS
---------------------------
Channelization is a mulitple-access method in which the available bandwidth of a link is shared in time, frequency or through code b/w different stations.

ALOHA

~ Aloha is a random access protocol.
~ It was actually designed for WLAN but it is also applicable for shared medium.
~ In this, multiple stations can transmit data at the same time and can hence lead to collision and data being garbled.

PURE ALOHA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Pure ALOHA allows stations to transmit whenever they have data to be sent.
~ When a station sends data it waits for an acknowledgement 
~ If the acknowledgement doesn't come within the alloted time then the station waits for a random amount of time called back-off
time (Tb) and re-sends the data.
~ Since different stations wait for different amount of time, the probability of further collision decreases.
~ The throughput of pure aloha is maximised when frames are of uniform length

~ Whenever two frames try to occupy the channel at the same time, there will be a collision and both will be
garbled.
~ If the first bit of a new frame overlaps with just the last bit of a frame almost finished, both frams will be totally
destroyed and both will have to be retransmitted later.
